# Node-with-babel-ES6
Setting up Babel in a Node server in order to use ES6 features like import/export and ES6 modules.  
Installed mocha & chai to create a testing suite that can be used for unit testing. For each file.js that is created there needs to be a file.test.js established in the tests folder.
